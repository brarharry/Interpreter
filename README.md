# Interpreter (written in Java 13.0.2 using IntelliJ on Windows 10) 
For this project, I implemented an interpreter for the mock language X.
Think of the mock language X as a simplified version of Java. The interpreter is responsible
for processing byte codes that are created from the source code files with the extension
x. The interpreter and the Virtual Machine (another class implemented by me)
work together to run a program written in the Language X. The two sample programs are a
recursive version of computing the nth Fibonacci number and recursively finding the factorial
of a number. These files have the extension x.cod.
